## Mental Models from Feynman 

下面 7 點當中我最愛的 3 點。

1. 避免資訊與工具不足的問題
2. 用 Bayesian 機率的角度思考，分清楚什麼是可能，以及什麼是已經發生的
3. 真正有效的模型，經得住時間的考驗

```
- Deciding whether someone truly knows their stuff or is mimicking
- To deal with uncertainty, about 'Grey Thinking', the ability to put things on a gradient from "probably true" to "probably false"
  - Bayesian updating — starting with a priori odds, based on earlier understanding, and "updating" the odds of something based on what you learn thereafter. 
- As we investigate whether something is true or not, new evidence and new methods of experimentation should show the effect getting stronger and stronger, not weaker.
- Make clear. "The problem is what is probable, what is happening."
- There is no sense in calculating the probability or the chance that something happens after it happens. (No hindsight)
- Use proper statistical sampling
- Many errors people make simply come from lack of information. They don’t even know they're missing the tools they need.
